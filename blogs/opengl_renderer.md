### Hello World!

And with that clich√© line the website is online! Well it was
online before but now it really is. The notes here are likely not going to have
any substanstial or ground breaking content (I wish). But I like to write notes
here so I can access them on a readable format when online and away from my
computer. Hopefully there are all kinds of notes, not just programming.

Here is to a successful start! Good bye!
